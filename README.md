# Asteroid Search

Little application for getting basic data about closest asteroids to Earth in given date interval.

It was implemented via Vite.js in React on frontend and Node.js on the backend.

You can start the app by commands "npm run dev" and "node server.js" in the root folder to get both up running.

Further dependecies used: react-datepicker for easy input of dates, node-fetch, axios, cors to successfully fetch the data.
